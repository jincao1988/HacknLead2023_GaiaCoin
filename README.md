### Business idea pitch at HacknLead 2023: GaiaCoin - where ESG meets Web 3. 

Context: HacknLead2023 took place in Ginetta workspace, Zurich. Over 220 applicants from diverse backround meet together for the first time over one weekend and try to display their ideas and/or product prototype to the audience.

Team members: Jin Cao, Mihaela Brankova, Daria Zorina, Silvia GÃ¶tti, Lilia Cojocaru

Business idea:
- GaiaCoin is a digital currency to be exchanged on SDX platform.
- Instead of a new form of investment, we foresee a different use: GaiaCoin as a representative of ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) actions of companies.
- Through chainlink and smart contract, based on the "good deeds" carried out by large corporates, their GaiaCoin will be transacted and tracked and used as an indicator or their impact on keep the earth a livable place.
- Due to its transparency and non-falsifiability, it will be promoted by the government and closely monitored by society.
- We hope this new KPI could help to raise attention of green impact of private companies.
